    View
    ====
    In the broad definition, the View should provide all the tools for the interaction between the user and the
    computer. These could be both through the command line or through a Graphical User Interface. In practice, however,
    command-line interfaces appear naturally once the models and controllers are properly developed. It is also possible
    to use Jupyter notebooks to interface with devices and perform experiments. Therefore, the View will be fundamentally
    responsible for generating graphical applications.
